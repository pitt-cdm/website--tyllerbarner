    <h1>What is Competitive Cheerleading?</h1>

    <p>Competitive Cheerleading is very different from sideline cheer. For one,
      the athletes do not shout or speak any cheers. Competitve Cheerleading, as
      the name implies, involves competitions, with two minute and thirty second
      length routines, which are practiced, over and over again.</p>

      <h2>Where do Competitve Cheerleaders practice?</h2>

      <p>Each competitive cheerleading team is a part of a cheer gym. These cheer
        gyms have a variety of different leveled teams. For example, there is level
        1, 2, 3, 4, 4.2, and 5. In some instances, there may be a level 6 team, however
        those teams are mainly colleged aged individuals or older. Each level determines
        what stunting skills and tumbling skills are required and allowed, and also
        determines the expected executions of other elements such as jumps, dance
        and overall routine flow.

      <h2>The Blue Mat</h2>

      <p>The Blue Mat is a primary symbol of competitve cheerleading. The blue
        mat is a spring floor with 7 panels. Cheer gyms have atleast one of these
        set up in their gym due to the fact that these are what cheerleaders compete
        on at competitions. Being centered is one of the most important parts of
        the visual aspect of a routine and teams may spend whole practices just
        practicing formations to make sure that everything and everyone is centered and
        in the right place. </p>
