    <h1>What is Competitive Cheerleading?</h1>

    <p>Competitive Cheerleading is very different from sideline cheer. For one,
      the athletes do not shout or speak any cheers.Competitve Cheerleading, as
      the name implies, involves competitions, with two minute and thirty second
      length routines, which are practiced, over and over again.</p>
