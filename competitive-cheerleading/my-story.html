        <p>My name is Tyller Barner and I cheered for about <strong>9 years</strong> of my life. </p>

        <p>I first started cheerleading when I was around 11 years old. All of my
          friends were little league cheerleaders and one of my best friends mentioned
          a new form of cheerleading that everyone was trying out. Competitve Cheerleading.
          From what she explained to me, this wouldn't involve me to just sit on
          the sideline and shout cheers. I decided to give it a try and joined
          a team.</p>

        <p>When I first started cheering, I did not have many skills. Somewhat of a
          late bloomer from starting later than my peers, I worked extremely hard
          to catch up with my teammates and get the skills that they all had. However,
          as I continued to take classes and practice, I was able to learn and execute
          more skills than when I first started.</p>

        <p>My biggest goal was to be on a level 5 team and compete at the cheerleading
          worlds, the biggest cheerleading competition, which happens every April in
          Disney World. Only level 5 (or some level 6) teams are invited and teams
          have to win an invitation. When I ended up moving from Pennsylvania to Ohio, I found a
          cheer gym that would allow me to develop my skills and reach my goal, three
          years in a row. American Elite.</p>

        <p>Cheerleading has been a very big proponent in helping me to come out of
          my shell. Through cheerleading I have made some of my best friends
          and have also learned how to work in teams. My favorite part of cheerleading
          was being able to test my limits inregards to making friends (I always used
          to be a shy kid), learning and practicing new skills, being a leader, and many
          others.
