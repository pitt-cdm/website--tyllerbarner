    <h2>More than just cheers</h2>

    <p>In recent years, competitive cheerleading has grown in popularity.
      While this form of cheerleading is pretty <em>different</em> from typical sideline
      cheerleading, there still remains a stigma that competitive cheerleading should
      not be considered a sport. Coaches and athletes have been continuously been
      creating routines and showing off new and harder skills, in order to not only
      improve the sport itself, but to also be recognized as a sport.</p>
