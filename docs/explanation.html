    <h1>What is Competitive Cheerleading?</h1>

    <p class='exp'>Competitive Cheerleading is very different from sideline cheerleading. There isn't
      much shouting of cheers for another sports team. Instead, competitve cheerleading, as
      the name implies, involves competitions with two minute and thirty second
      length routines, which are practiced over and over again throughout a cheer season.</p>

      <h2>Where do Competitve Cheerleaders practice?</h2>

      <p>Each competitive cheerleading team is a part of a cheer gym. These cheer
        gyms have a variety of different leveled teams. For example, there is levels
        1, 2, 3, 4, 4.2, and 5. In some instances, there may be a level 6 team. However,
        those teams are mainly college-aged individuals or older. Each level determines
        what stunting skills and tumbling skills are required and allowed and also
        determines the expected executions of other elements, such as jumps, dance
        and overall routine flow.

      <h2>The Blue Mat</h2>

      <p>The Blue Mat is a primary symbol of competitve cheerleading. The Blue
        Mat is a spring floor with 7 panels. Cheer gyms have at least one of these
        set up in their gym due to the fact that these are what cheerleaders compete
        on at competitions. Being centered is one of the most important parts of
        the visual aspect of a routine, and teams may spend whole practices just
        practicing formations to make sure that everything and everyone is centered and
        in the right place. </p>

      <h2>Competitions</h2>

      <p>Each cheer season has a different number of competitions. Within each level
        there are a few elite competitions that teams can compete to be invited to. For example,
        there is The Summit and Worlds. The Summit is a competition that takes place in Disney World
        and levels 1, 2, 3, 4 and 4.2 are invited to compete in this competition. Worlds (arguably
        the biggest competition in the cheer world) also takes place at Disney World and levels
        5 and 6 are invited to compete here. In order to be invited to these two competitions,
        you must receive a bid. There are three kinds of bids: 1.) At-Large (no money is given) 2.)
        Partial Paid ($250 is rewarded to each athlete on the team) 3.) Full Paid (Hotel, Disney Hopper
        Pass, and competition fees paid for each athlete on a team). In order to
        get invited to one of these competitions, teams must attend a competition
        that awards a bid. Being invited to these competitions is a goal that many
        set out to achieve. (Below is my old team and me winning a full paid bid to Worlds)</p>

        <h2>Teamwork</h2>

        <p>Teamwork is the driving force behind cheerleading. Without a well cohesive
          team, routines will not come together. Every athlete on the floor must feel
          like they are apart of a team, a piece of a whole, in order to feel confident,
          passionate, and able in the skills that they are performing on the floor. Establishing
          teamwork is an essential aspect of cheerleading, and teams who do not get along
          and are not there for each other find it hard to be successful. No matter who
          your closest friends are, the lasting bonds of being on a team with someone
          are forever.</p>
