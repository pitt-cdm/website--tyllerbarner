      <h2>Tumbling</h2>

      <p>Tumbling is a vital element of cheerleading. Above you see a cheerleader
        performing a round off, arabian, backhandspring, full. This for example,
        is a level 5 skill that would be competed in the running tumbling section
      of a routine. </p>

      <h2>Stunts</h2>

      <p>Stunts are the most important aspect of a cheer routine. There are 4 positions: <em><strong>Main Base</em></strong> (controls the flyers foot),
        <em><strong>Side Base</em></strong> (supports flyers foot and main base) <em><strong>Backspot</em></strong> (supports from behind the stunt) and
        <em><strong>Flyer</em></strong> (does skills in the air). Stunts have the most weight on a team's score
        and one mishap in a stunt can really hurt a team's overall score. </p>

      <p>Since these hold the overall weight of a routine, teams work extremely
        hard to perfect tough skills to raise their score and also to ensure that if there
        may be a mishap, their difficulty can compensate for it. The stunts above are
        a switch up (flyer switches feet when being thrown in the air) and a double
        up (flyer spins twice in a bases hand before facing the front again).</p>

      <h2>Basket Tosses</h2>

      <p>Basket Tosses get their name from the way in which the bases(throwers)
        hands are interwoven together like a basket. In a cheer routine, there is
        a dedicated section to basket tosses, however, specialty basket tosses are used
        throughout the routine in various places. The particular basket toss in the image
        above is a "hitch, kick double down" and is a typical basket used in a level
        5 routine.</p>

      <h2>Jumps</h2>

      <img src='cheerpics/kjump.JPG'>

      <p>Jumps are dreaded by most cheerleaders because the execution of getting
        the perfect timing can take two to three full practices all together. The
        jump pictured above is a toe touch and usually in cheer routines that are level
        three and higher, there is a jump sequence section where 3 or 4 jumps
        are connected together and then a tumbling skill is connected at the end of
        the sequence.</p>

    <h2>Pyramid</h2>

    <p>Pyramid is usually at the end of the routine and is when everyone on the
      team comes together to create a very large stunt structure and to do skills
      where everyone is connected. This is part of a routine where teams can show
      off amazing connectedness and athleticism. There are many explosive elements
      in pyramids and some of the best teams have extravagent, fast flowing and
      ambitious pyramids.</p>
